# BingBonk

An open source recreation of my original Bonk gamemode. Developed in part by myself and Bing.

## Disclaimer

As of the current state of this project, Bonk is not intended to be user-friendly, easy to use, or frequently updated. I figured it would be nice to provide an open source repository for the Bonk code, but please understand I may not be able to (or want to) answer support queries. If you have any questions, however, please join my [Discord server](https://chat.ksc.sh) so we can chat.

## Requirements

- Paper >=1.16.5
  - BingBonk is compiled and tested against Paper. This means that Spigot is not supported (and never will be).
- Java >=16
